# Memory Schema Specification

This document defines the Memory object fields for both the Python and TypeScript SDKs. The two representations are conceptually equivalent but use language-appropriate naming and typing conventions.

## Python Memory Dataclass

```python
@dataclass
class Memory:
    id: str                              # UUID v4, primary key
    content: str                         # The stored text content
    category: str                        # Classification label (e.g. "preference", "fact", "event")
    importance: float                    # 0.0–1.0, how important this memory is (set at creation, can be promoted)
    stability: float                     # 0.0–1.0, how resistant to decay (increases with repeated access)
    access_count: int                    # Number of times this memory has been retrieved
    last_accessed_at: datetime           # Timestamp of last retrieval
    created_at: datetime                 # Timestamp of creation
    embedding: list[float] | None        # Vector embedding of content (None for stubs)
    associations: dict[str, float]       # Map of linked memory_id -> weight (0.0–1.0)
    session_ids: list[str]              # Sessions in which this memory was created or accessed
    is_cold: bool                        # True if memory has been migrated to cold storage
    cold_since: datetime | None          # Timestamp of cold migration (None if hot)
    days_at_floor: int                   # Number of decay cycles spent at the retention floor
    is_superseded: bool                  # True if this memory has been replaced by a newer one
    superseded_by: str | None            # ID of the memory that supersedes this one
    contradicted_by: str | None          # ID of the memory that contradicted this one
    is_stub: bool                        # True if converted to a lightweight stub
    memory_type: str                     # Semantic type: "fact", "preference", "plan", "transient_state", "other"
    valid_from: Optional[datetime]       # Start of temporal validity window (None = always valid)
    valid_until: Optional[datetime]      # End of temporal validity window (None = no expiry)
    ttl_seconds: Optional[int]           # Time-to-live in seconds from creation (None = no TTL)
    source_turn_ids: list[str]           # Conversation turn IDs that contributed to this memory
```

### Field Details

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | `str` | uuid4() | Unique identifier. Generated at creation. |
| `content` | `str` | required | The textual content of the memory. Extracted from conversations or provided directly. |
| `category` | `str` | `"general"` | Classification label used for filtering and organization. Common values: `"preference"`, `"fact"`, `"event"`, `"relationship"`, `"general"`. |
| `importance` | `float` | `0.5` | Initial importance score. Range 0.0–1.0. Set by the extraction LLM or manually. Memories above 0.8 are candidates for core promotion. |
| `stability` | `float` | `0.0` | Resistance to decay. Increases with each access. Higher stability means slower decay. Range 0.0–1.0. |
| `access_count` | `int` | `0` | Incremented each time the memory is returned in a search result. Used for core promotion thresholds. |
| `last_accessed_at` | `datetime` | creation time | Updated on each retrieval. Used to calculate time-since-last-access for the decay formula. |
| `created_at` | `datetime` | now | Immutable creation timestamp. |
| `embedding` | `list[float] \| None` | `None` | Vector embedding generated from `content`. Typically 1536 dimensions (OpenAI) or 384 (MiniLM). Set to `None` for stubs. |
| `associations` | `dict[str, float]` | `{}` | Weighted links to other memories. Keys are memory IDs, values are weights (0.0–1.0). Built automatically during ingestion and consolidation. |
| `session_ids` | `list[str]` | `[]` | Tracks which sessions contributed to or accessed this memory. Used for session-scoped queries. |
| `is_cold` | `bool` | `False` | Set to `True` when the memory is migrated to cold storage after prolonged low retention. |
| `cold_since` | `datetime \| None` | `None` | Timestamp of when the memory was moved to cold storage. `None` while hot. |
| `days_at_floor` | `int` | `0` | Counts consecutive decay cycles where retention was at the floor value. Used to trigger cold migration (e.g. after 30 days at floor). |
| `is_superseded` | `bool` | `False` | Set to `True` when a newer memory contradicts and replaces this one. Superseded memories are excluded from normal search but available via deep recall. |
| `superseded_by` | `str \| None` | `None` | ID of the replacement memory. Forms a chain for tracking memory evolution. |
| `contradicted_by` | `str \| None` | `None` | ID of the memory that introduced the contradiction. May differ from `superseded_by` if resolution created a third memory. |
| `is_stub` | `bool` | `False` | Set to `True` when the memory is converted to a stub. Stubs retain `id`, `content` (summary), and association references but drop the embedding. |
| `memory_type` | `str` | `"other"` | Semantic type of the memory. Values: `"fact"`, `"preference"`, `"plan"`, `"transient_state"`, `"other"`. Distinct from `category` which is a free-form classification label. |
| `valid_from` | `Optional[datetime]` | `None` | Start of the temporal validity window. `None` means the memory is valid from creation. |
| `valid_until` | `Optional[datetime]` | `None` | End of the temporal validity window. `None` means no scheduled expiry. |
| `ttl_seconds` | `Optional[int]` | `None` | Time-to-live in seconds from creation. When set, the memory should be considered expired after `created_at + ttl_seconds`. `None` means no TTL. |
| `source_turn_ids` | `list[str]` | `[]` | IDs of the conversation turns that contributed to extracting this memory. Used for provenance tracking. |

## Search Response Types (TypeScript)

```typescript
interface StageTrace {
  stage: string;                        // Name of the search pipeline stage (e.g. "vector", "lexical", "rerank")
  inputCount: number;                   // Number of candidates entering this stage
  outputCount: number;                  // Number of candidates leaving this stage
  durationMs: number;                   // Time spent in this stage in milliseconds
  promptTokens: number;                 // LLM prompt tokens used in this stage (0 for non-LLM stages)
  completionTokens: number;            // LLM completion tokens used in this stage (0 for non-LLM stages)
  metadata?: Record<string, unknown>;   // Optional stage-specific debug data
}

interface SearchTrace {
  totalDurationMs: number;              // Total wall-clock time for the search
  totalTokens: number;                  // Sum of all prompt + completion tokens across stages
  stages: StageTrace[];                 // Ordered list of pipeline stage traces
}

interface SearchResponse {
  results: ScoredMemory[];              // Ranked results
  trace?: SearchTrace;                  // Optional pipeline trace (included when `debug: true`)
}
```

## Field Mapping: Python <-> TypeScript

| Python Field | TypeScript Field | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | `id` | Same |
| _(no equivalent)_ | `userId` | TypeScript adds explicit multi-tenancy. Python passes user_id at the API level. |
| `content` | `content` | Same |
| `category` | `memoryType` | String in Python, enum in TypeScript. Same values. |
| `importance` | `importance` | Same |
| `stability` | `stability` | Same |
| `access_count` | `accessCount` | snake_case vs camelCase |
| `last_accessed_at` | `lastAccessed` | Python uses `datetime`, TypeScript uses `Date` |
| _(computed)_ | `retention` | TypeScript stores the current retention score. Python computes it on the fly in the engine. |
| `created_at` | `createdAt` | snake_case vs camelCase |
| _(no equivalent)_ | `updatedAt` | TypeScript-only. Tracks last mutation. |
| `embedding` | `embedding` | `list[float]` vs `number[]` |
| `associations` | `metadata.associations` | Top-level in Python, nested in TypeScript's metadata |
| `session_ids` | `metadata.sessionIds` | Top-level in Python, nested in TypeScript's metadata |
| `is_cold` | `metadata.isCold` | Top-level in Python, nested in TypeScript's metadata |
| `cold_since` | `metadata.coldSince` | Top-level in Python, nested in TypeScript's metadata |
| `days_at_floor` | `metadata.daysAtFloor` | Top-level in Python, nested in TypeScript's metadata |
| `is_superseded` | `metadata.isSuperseded` | Top-level in Python, nested in TypeScript's metadata |
| `superseded_by` | `metadata.supersededBy` | Top-level in Python, nested in TypeScript's metadata |
| `contradicted_by` | `metadata.contradictedBy` | Top-level in Python, nested in TypeScript's metadata |
| `is_stub` | `metadata.isStub` | Top-level in Python, nested in TypeScript's metadata |
| `memory_type` | `semanticType` | Python uses `memory_type` (str). TypeScript uses `semanticType` (enum) because `memoryType` is already deprecated. Same value set. |
| `valid_from` | `validFrom` | Python `datetime`, TypeScript Unix ms `number`. |
| `valid_until` | `validUntil` | Python `datetime`, TypeScript Unix ms `number`. |
| `ttl_seconds` | `ttlSeconds` | Same semantics. |
| `source_turn_ids` | `sourceTurnIds` | snake_case vs camelCase |

### Design Rationale

The Python SDK uses a flat dataclass because it evolved from a research prototype where quick attribute access mattered. The TypeScript SDK groups lifecycle and tiering fields under `metadata` to keep the top-level interface clean for application developers who primarily interact with `content`, `importance`, and `retention`. The mapping table above ensures serialization layers can convert between the two representations without data loss.
